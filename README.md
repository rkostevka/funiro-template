Responsive site layout. 
This is a one page site with a shopping cart and products. 
There is a header with a drop-down menu and a search, there is a burger menu. 
There are adaptive spoilers in the footer. 
The main slider is made of flex and grid layout, as well as dynamic responsive. 
Products are added to the cart, and more products are loaded from the JSON file! 
An interesting gallery of pictures has been implemented, based on flex and grid grids, the opening of a picture in a popup, as well as a smooth movement of the gallery when the mouse cursor moves.
